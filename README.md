A code to read IMU values and transfer it to a haptic/visual graphic output

This is an attempt to dive deeply into the world of coding and open source.  I am deeply interested in the human body and movement as data.   I am also interested in reintroducing physicality into data systems by exploring applications that converts data back into physical form and space.
